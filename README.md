## Student Registration

The goal with this sample project is to illustrate the basic data structures and algorithms in Java:

- [ ] Variables
- [ ] Data types
- [ ] Arraylist
- [ ] Methods
- [ ] Constructors
- [ ] Accessors
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Conditional statements
- [ ] Return statements
- [ ] Operators in Java
- [ ] In-built functions in Java such as Scanner, ArrayList


- This is a sample logic that can be used to register a student in a school. 
- The concepts applied are in Java. 
- The output is on the terminal
- Part of the logic is hard-coded to illustrate how the entire registration process could turn out
- No database is used in this illustration
