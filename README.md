## Student Registration

The goal with this sample project is to illustrate the use of basic data structures and algorithms in Java:

- [x] Variables
- [x] Data types
- [x] Arraylist
- [x] Methods
- [x] Constructors
- [x] Accessors
- [x] Loops
- [x] Conditional statements
- [x] Return statements
- [x] Operators in Java
- [x] In-built functions in Java such as Scanner, ArrayList
<br>

- This is a sample logic that can be used to register a student in a school. 
- The concepts applied are in Java. 
- The output is on the terminal
- Part of the logic is hard-coded to illustrate how the entire registration process could turn out
- No database is used in this illustration


## Usage

- Clone this repo to your local machine
    ```java
    $ git clone git@github.com:GitauHarrison/demo-student-registration-program-in-java.git
    ```
- Move into the cloned directory
    ```java
    $ cd demo-student-registration-program-in-java
    ```
- Run the program

    ```java
    // Depending on your IDE/text editor
    ```
- You will see this:
![Program running in the terminal](/registerStudent/sample_terminal.png)
- Follow the prompts to test out the project

## Areas of Improvement

- Add GUI
- Use a database
